Andrea's Analysis

While into the price of wine reviewed distribution, we could see that over ninety percent of reviews relate to wines priced under $500 dollars. In this DataSet, the wines with higher prices were produced in France and the US.
This analyses include wines produced in a total of 42 countries, with prices that varies from $4 dollars to $3,300 dollars per bottle.

While comparing the ratings and the price per bottle we can see that most wines with lower prices received good rating. We also noticed that the bottle with the highest price in this DataSet, received a lower rating.



Rutva Korat's Analysis

In this dataset we have about 120,000 row of data on wines that have been reviewed by wine sommeliers and connoisseurs.
Within this dataset we came to know that there are 691 different types of wine that have been reviewed. Within those types of wines we were able to determine how many reviews each type of wine had. In our findings we were able to determine that some types of wine had thousands of reviews while other types only had one review. We decided to look into the 10 most rated wine types to see if there is a relationship between its pricing and rating. We wanted to know if the pricing of the bottle of wine that had been reviewed has any effect on its rated score. 

Here we took the top ten wine types that had the most ratings and decided to find the correlation of price to rating of each of them. The bar chart titled “Correlation Between Price and Rating by Top 10 Wine Types” show cases the correlation of each grouping of wine type from the top ten wines types. We can see here that Cabernet Sauvignon has the highest correlation and Rosé had the least correlation when comparing the pricing to their ratings. Overall we can determine that none of the top ten wine types have a strong correlation of pricing to rating. We can say that Cabernet Sauvignon has the highest correlation compared to the rest of the top wine types rated. Cabernet Sauvignon’s that have been rated in this dataset have a correlation of 0.556 which is considered as a moderate correlation while Rosé that have been reviewed in this data set have a weaker correlation of 0.262. From the top ten types of wine reviewed we have an overall correlation of 0.404 which is also considered as less than moderate correlation. With this we can state that out of the top wines rated from this dataset the rating is given moderately to the wines price points.
