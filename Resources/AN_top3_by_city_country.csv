Wafts of soft smokiness create the impression of a cloud within which red fruit slumbers. This is youthful and comes with a smoky backbone of a structure—a beautiful faultline of fresh acidity. To appropriate a well-used metaphor, this is like a firm handshake from a hand gloved in vermilion velvet. With some time, tender notes of morello cherry tantalizingly appear.
